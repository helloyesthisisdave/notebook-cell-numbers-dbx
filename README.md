# Notebook Cell Numbers

> Persistent cell numbers, editable titles, and a Notebook Outline sidebar for every VS Code notebook.

No more manually counting cells or hunting for the right one — each cell displays its position directly in the status bar, and a sidebar outline lets you jump anywhere instantly.

Works on VS Code, VSCodium, and Code OSS.

## Features

- **Persistent cell numbers** — shown on every cell, both code and markdown
- **Editable cell titles** — set a custom label per cell, stored in notebook metadata
- **Notebook Outline** — sidebar panel listing all cells with language icons, execution status, content preview on hover, and click-to-navigate
- **Go to Cell command** — jump to any cell by number or title from the command palette
- **Universal** — works with Jupyter notebooks, interactive windows, and any other VS Code notebook type
- **Auto-updating** — numbers stay correct when cells are added, removed, or reordered
- **Fully configurable** — control the format string, starting index, and alignment

## Notebook Outline

The **Notebook Outline** panel appears in the Explorer sidebar whenever a `.ipynb` file is active. It lists every cell with:

- **Language icons** — code cells show the icon for their language (Python, R, TypeScript, etc.), sourced from your active file icon theme
- **Execution status** — once a cell has been run, the icon switches to a coloured status indicator matching the notebook's own style: green check for success, red error for failure
- **Execution order** — the `[n]` run count is shown in the description alongside the first line of the cell
- **Markdown headings** — markdown cell labels strip syntax characters so `## Introduction` appears as `Introduction`
- **Hover preview** — hover any entry to see a syntax-highlighted preview of the full cell content
- **Click to navigate** — clicking an entry scrolls the notebook to that cell

## How it works

The extension uses VS Code's `NotebookCellStatusBarItemProvider` API to inject a label into every cell's built-in status bar — no custom renderers, no webviews, no DOM manipulation. Cell titles are stored in notebook metadata so they persist with the file. The Notebook Outline is a native VS Code tree view that re-renders automatically as the notebook changes. Language icons are resolved at runtime by reading the active file icon theme's JSON definition, so any SVG-based theme works without configuration.
